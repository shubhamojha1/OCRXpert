# OCRXpert
OCR is a technology that converts scanned documents or images into editable and searchable text. However, the accuracy of OCR heavily depends on the quality of the input image. Poor quality images with low resolution, poor lighting, and low contrast can lead to significant OCR errors, making it difficult to obtain accurate text output.  

This project, OCRXpert is a tool designed to identify such poor quality images, filtering them out before they are passed to OCR. The tool uses various image processing and analysis techniques to determine factors that affect OCR accuracy, such as image sharpness, contrast, color balance, and noise level. Once the images have been evaluated, the tool can either reject or accept the images based on their OCR readiness.  The purpose of this project is to save time and increase accuracy by minimizing the need for manual intervention in image selection. The tool can also be integrated with OCR engines, making the process of image selection and OCR extraction faster and more accurate.  This project can be particularly useful in data entry tasks, where large amounts of data need to be extracted from scanned documents, as well as in document management and information retrieval applications, where accurate OCR is essential. Additionally, the tool can be customized to fit specific use cases and can be extended to support additional image formats, languages, and OCR engines.
